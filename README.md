# Customer Orders CLIENT
A simple Next.js web application responsible for displaying customers and their orders from a Customer Orders API

Just a little side project for practicing my React, Next.js and Tailwind CSS skills.

## Getting Started

First, install the project dependencies, then run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
